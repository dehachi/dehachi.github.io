What kind of volunteer work do you want to do?
Kei Sakaide
Efforts are underway to find a cure for the new coronavirus. 
One of them is a project that you can participate in at home. 
It's called "Folding@home," a project that uses the spare CPU and GPU of a PC to analyze diseases. 
I can't go out now because of the coronavirus. 
However, you can contribute to this problem from home by participating in this project. 
The power consumption is not very high, so it doesn't have a big impact on your work. 
Why don't you volunteer for this?
